# AI Multi-Domain ML System 🚀  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is an **AI-powered multi-domain learning system** that demonstrates expertise across **all major areas of machine learning**.  

It integrates:  
- 📈 **Regression** → Finance: Stock price prediction  
- 🩺 **Classification** → Healthcare: Disease classification  
- 🛍️ **Clustering** → Retail: Customer segmentation  
- 💬 **NLP** → Social Media: Sentiment analysis  
- 🖼️ **Computer Vision** → Image classification/object detection  

The goal is to build a **unified ML pipeline** with:  
- ✅ Data preprocessing & feature engineering  
- ✅ Model training, evaluation & optimization  
- ✅ Explainability (SHAP, LIME)  
- ✅ Experiment tracking (MLflow)  
- ✅ Deployment (FastAPI + Streamlit + Docker + Cloud)
