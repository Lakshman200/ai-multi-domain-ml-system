AI Multi-Domain ML System 🚀
📌 Project Overview
This project is an AI-powered multi-domain learning system that demonstrates expertise across all major areas of machine learning.
It integrates:
Regression → Finance: Stock price prediction
Classification → Healthcare: Disease classification
Clustering → Retail: Customer segmentation
NLP → Social Media: Sentiment analysis
Computer Vision → Image classification/object detection
The goal is to create a unified ML pipeline with:
Data preprocessing & feature engineering
Model training, evaluation & optimization
Explainability (SHAP, LIME)
Experiment tracking (MLflow)
Deployment (FastAPI + Streamlit + Docker + Cloud)
